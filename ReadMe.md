# Learning Microservice Project

I took a udemy course, [Microservices with Node JS and React](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react/), and this is the project I created following the course.

The course is a bit misleading as it's actually more Next, Typescript, Kubernetes, Docker, and Skaffold.

If you want to try this out. You need to install kubernetes and build the images of each service, then you need to do some set up on k8s directory and set up some secrets first.
